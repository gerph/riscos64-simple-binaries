## 0.07 (05 Dec 2024)

### Security
- 

### Added
- stdlib: Implementation of `abort`.
- string: Implementation of `atoi`.
- ctypes: Implementation of `toupper`, `tolower`.
- stdio: Implementation of `remove`, `rename`, `tmpnam`.
- time: Implementation of `time` and `gmtime`.
- release: Rudimentary implementation of a build tool, `robuild64`, although the build environment will supplant this in the future.

### Changed
- environment: The `abort` implementation gives a backtrace, as well as it can.
- internal: Many of the files split up so that functions aren't linked if they aren't needed.

### Fixed
- time: `clock` now uses the program's start time as the base time, not the boot of the OS.
- linking: Function signature stamping should now recognise local symbols as well as global symbols.

### Removed
-
